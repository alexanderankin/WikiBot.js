GLOBAL OPTIONS
==============
(Global arguments available for all bots)

-dir:PATH         Read the bot's configuration data from directory given by
                  PATH, instead of from the default directory.

-lang:xx          Set the language of the wiki you want to work on, overriding
                  the configuration in user-config.py. xx should be the
                  language code.

-family:xyz       Set the family of the wiki you want to work on, e.g.
                  wikipedia, wiktionary, wikitravel, ...
                  This will override the configuration in user-config.py.

-user:xyz         Log in as user 'xyz' instead of the default username.

-daemonize:xyz    Immediately return control to the terminal and redirect
                  stdout and stderr to file xyz.
                  (only use for bots that require no input from stdin).

-help             Show this help text.

-log              Enable the log file, using the default filename
                  '%s-bot.log'
                  Logs will be stored in the logs subdirectory.

-log:xyz          Enable the log file, using 'xyz' as the filename.

-nolog            Disable the log file (if it is enabled by default).

-maxlag           Sets a new maxlag parameter to a number of seconds. Defer bot
                  edits during periods of database server lag. Default is set
                  by config.py

-putthrottle:n    Set the minimum time (in seconds) the bot will wait between
-pt:n             saving pages.
-put_throttle:n

-debug:item       Enable the log file and include extensive debugging data
-debug            for component "item" (for all components if the second form
                  is used).

-verbose          Have the bot provide additional console output that may be
-v                useful in debugging.

-cosmeticchanges  Toggles the cosmetic_changes setting made in config.py or
-cc               user-config.py to its inverse and overrules it. All other
                  settings and restrictions are untouched.

-simulate         Disables writing to the server. Useful for testing and
                  debugging of new code (if given, doesn't do any real
                  changes, but only shows what would have been changed).

-<config var>:n   You may use all given numeric config variables as option and
                  modify it with command line.
